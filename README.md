# Mélange

Like a lot of people, when I find something that's hard I often write a script or similar to make it easier. Many of those scripts end up here, where it's easier for me to keep track of them, maintain them, and share them. [Pull requests](https://github.com/Calrion/Melange/pulls) are welcome!

## Why Mélange?
I figured it'd be helpful if I gave this an actual name and not just call it "utilities" or something. Mélange means a mixture or medley, and is also used in geology to mean a completely disordered mixture of rocks of totally different sizes, shapes, origins, and ages. Sounds appropriate, don't you think?

Do note, however, that while the name does include an acute accent on the first letter 'e', this is omitted (i.e. it's just a regular 'e') in code, the repository name, and anywhere else it might cause trouble or confusion.
